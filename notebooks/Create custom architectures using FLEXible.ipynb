    "# Create custom federated architectures using FLEXible\n",

    "In this notebook we show how to create customs architetures when working FLEXible. We hope that this notebook will help users to learn how to use the `FlexPool` class in case they want to create different architectures from the two available in the `FlexPool` class. Those methods are, `client_server_architecture` and `p2p_architecture`, and are the most probable type of architectures that might be found during a federated learning experiment, but it might be interesting to create another architecture."
